Below is the list of large (at least 18 inches diagonal) monochrome	monitors which Computer Shopper lists as PC compatible.  I've omitted	Radius because Radius states that they no longer support the PC.	You will notice that Nanao is the only one which supports a 31.5Khz	horizontal frequency, which is the frequency normally used by VGA cards	at boot up.  My guess is that all the other monitors come with their	own graphics cards.  I've left voice mail with Nanao asking them to	send me some literature, and will report back to the net after I've	studied it.	The prices given appear to be list prices and have little relationship	to reality.

A friend of mine needs spec for a used hard drive he just got:	It is a Western Digital, IDE, 340 meg	with 1010 cylinders and 12 heads.  We believe the model number is	wd2340A, but we can't be sure.  It is a 12 ms, 3.5" model.	Any info would be appreciated, either from somone who knows, or maybe	western digitals phone number	Thanks

I think there are several reasons :-	50MHz motherboards are harder to get right	50MHz need a fast L2 cache - 12-15ns is a good idea	50MHz needs to be slowed down to make a compliant VESA bus	66MHz DX2 chips are faster for a lot of things	With a good, fast L2 cache a DX2/66 is going be be faster than a DX50...

Caching controller! Why? What does it give you that smartdrive ( for DOS ) does	not? About 30KB extra lower memory! That's about it.

Our 20-month son has started falling sick quite often every since he	started going to day care.  He was at home for the first year and he did	not fall sick even once.  Now it seems like he has some sort of cold or	flu pretty much once a month.  Most of the time the cold leads to an ear	infection as well, with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics	3 weeks out of 4.  I know kids in day care fall sick more often, but we	are beginning to wonder how often "more often" really is, whether our	son is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average, what the	longer-term effects of constantly being sick and taking antibiotics are,	and what we can do to build up his resistance.  He really enjoys his day	care and we think it's great too, but we are beginning to wonder whether	we should think about getting a nanny.	Are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions?	-- How often do kids in their first, second and third years fall sick?	How often do they get colds, flus, ear infections?  Is there any data on	home care vs. day care?	-- Does being sick "build immunity" (leading to less illness later),	does it make kids "weaker" (leading to more illness later), or does it	not have any long term effect?	-- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long	term effects?	-- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than	normal, and what does one do about it?	-- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?	Any data, information or advice relating to this would be much	appreciated.  Thanks a lot.	Ashwin.

The degree of	elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten times	normal. Other blood chemistries are usually normal.	As a rule, patients with CPH have no clinical signs of liver disease.	Chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, at	least initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means of	a biopsy. The patient with CPH only needs to be reassured. The patient with	CAH needs to be treated.	======================================	Howard Doyle	doyle+@pitt.edu
