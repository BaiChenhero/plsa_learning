Help....	I need to implement COM3 and COM4 on a board that I'm designing and I'm	finding it dificult to track down a definition (hardware that is) of COM3	and COM4.	I have the IO adresses and the fact that COM3 shares IRQ4 with COM1 and COM4	shares IRQ3 with COM2, except exactly how this IRQ sharing is done is not	clear especially if the existing COM1/2 does not allow IRQ sharing. Does the	standard??? allow for a different IRQ to be used and if so how.	Please answer by email to :-	neil@stone.oz.au	thanks in advance	Neil Watkinson.

Nntp-Posting-Host: astro.ocis.temple.edu	X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]	This may be the dumbest question of the year, but is there a	way to 'piggyback' or expand a 6-slot motherboard (all 16-bit)	to get the usual 8?  My case has slots for 8, and I'd like to	get a scanner, but with all my other cards I'm already max'd out!	I'm hoping that a simple solution exists, e.g. an adapter that turns	one slot into three.  I don't mind if it turns it into 8-bit slots,	as I can put my I/O card, MIDI card, and Soundblaster card there.	My other cards are 16 bit (IDE/Floppy, SVGA, modem).	If there is such an expander, does that screw up performance of	everything else?

I would like advice on how to configure my 486 to accept:	- Com1 + Com2  (currently on IRQ 4 and 3)	- LPT1 (IRQ7)	- Bus Mouse (IRQ5)	- Sound Card (no idea what to do - can be set to any)	-	using IRQ2 for Bus MOuse gobbled up too many cycles, and caused	loss of communications with floppy disks, and a few other	problems.	I could, I suppose, switch the 2 com devices externally, and disable	the second port on the Super IO card, but I really want to	have them both available.	COuld the sound card use IRQ2 without horsing up the works?	All replies apppreciated - and I only just subscribed to this	newsgroup - I assume there is an FAQ somewhere (rather, I'm	sure someone will tell me about it....)	thanks	Mark Fraser

Nntp-Posting-Host: eniac.seas.upenn.edu	Hello.  I hope somebody out here can help me.  I am currently working	on a project where I am trying to communicate from an IBM 386 with	Phoenix BIOS, using C++, to a board that I made with an Intel 8085 CPU	with UART chip.  The board works fine with the TRANSMIT command and	Terminal Emulation mode of Kermit, but there seems to be something wrong	with the initialization or protocol used when I try C++.  I need to	access the unit I built using C, because I have a sizable chunk of C	code that I will be using to perform calculations and operations that	will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085.	I have included the assembly code that I am running and the C++ code	that I am trying to use.  If anyone can show me something that I	am doing blatantly incorrectly or that I am missing because of my lack	of knowledge about RS-232 serial communications, please e-mail me.	I wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and	then to check it against the 0x20 character, if a 0x20 is received,	the LEDs will indicate this.  Two C++ programs that I have written do	nothing, but set up COM port 2 and send the 0x20 character.  One uses	the bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt	int86() function in dos.h.  I have triple checked the baud rate ( 2400 )	the parity ( none ) the stop bits ( 1 ) the character length ( 8 bits )	and the interrupt calls for ( 0x14 ).  Currently, I am at a loss as	to what may be wrong.  Any hardware gurus out there want to comment?

In article <C50CMD.1zz@newcastle.ac.uk>, Tor-Olav.Berntzen@newcastle.ac.uk (Tor-Olav Berntzen)	writes:	>Another thing, why a SCSI interface ? [for MDs]	>	>By giving the 2.5"MO a floppy interface it could reduce the price of it and	>make it easily installed in existing devices.	This question is, to me, like asking "Why use SCSI at all?"	- Due to the rather primitive standard DMA solution (which is used by almost all	floppy interfaces) of PCs, the speed is limited to approx 500 Kbytes/s.	I want a standard allowing higher performance.	- With SCSI, the OS can issue a request to the disk and then go ahead with other	things. Later, when the controller has performed the search and physical read,	data can be transferred to main memory at "RAM speeds". Not very relevant with	MS-DOS, but MS-DOS is not made for the future.	- I've *got* a SCSI interface. I've got a 5.25" and a 3.5" floppy, too, and I am	not going to throw them out. With SCSI I may add, for all practical purposes,	an "unlimited" number of disk units without sacrificing any of my old disks.	- For my PC, I've got a 300 Mbyte SCSI disk adopted from a SUN machine, and I	can carry it over to a Mac, a Sparcstation, an Alpha machine... whatever I like	to, if I decide to turn my back to the PC. (I *do* know that I cannot expect	to move the data without reformatting!)	There are probably numerous other reasons for SCSI as well.	>After all it is a floppy replacement we are taking about. 128Mb isnt all that	>much, so it isnt going to replace the need of a fast fixed disk.	No, not replace, but supplement. And contrary to a floppy, a MD may be fast enough	to run programs (or access data) directly off the MD. So we'll have much higher	expectations/demands, which is much better supported by SCSI than the old floppy	interface. And the price of SCSI controllers is not that high any more - isn't it	something like a dozen large pizzas, nowadays? :-)	ka.

News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41	Nntp-Posting-Host: ubvmsd.cc.buffalo.edu	Just a quick THANKS to the many who explained the backing up of my	masters.  Apparently they are NOT copy-protected; I just used a program that	is unable to handle high-density (old shit).  I was surprised to hear that	"NO programs on high-density disks have copy protection," which someone	back there said.  Huh!  Learn something new every day!	- Mitch

This is for a friend of mine. Please send answers directly to him (E-Mail	adress see below )!	HIGHSPEED  ANALOG-DIGITAL PC-BOARD	Hello LAdies and Gentleman !	I am looking for a highspeed A/D PC-Board with a sampling rate above 250 MHz an a	resolution of 8-bit. The sampling rate can be arranged by an interleave mode where	the time equivalent sampling yields 2, 4 or 8 times higher sampling rate than	the A/D-Converter uses in non interleave mode.	The board must content an A/D-Converter similar to Analog Devices AD 9028 or	AD 9038 or if available a faster on.

No	motherboard can sense the speed of the RAM installed, unless you call	failing as a sort of auto-sense.  This is how you can sometimes use	"slower" RAM in a machine.

Yes only your $00.02.  Here's mine.	If I were running at a new chip at a Trade show, and had little to no real	technical knowledge,  I wouldn't let some stranger with a diskette boot my demo	machine.

No rumour, IBM's clock tripling chip was seen in some trade show last	fall (COMDEX or something, I wasn't there). All you people who are	drooling after this chip do realize that it has no FPU, just like	486SX, that Evil Marketing Ploy(tm) from Intel, don't you? It has 16K	of internal cache, which probably is where the saved silicon real	estate went. Because of some contract, IBM is not allowed to sell its	486 chips to third parties, so these chips are unlikely to become	available in any non-IBM machines. Of course, nothing prevents other	companies from implementing a DX3/99, but nobody hasn't even come out	with a real 486DX (FPU and all) clone yet (although AMD soon will).	--	Segmented Memory Helps Structure Software

Husak - husak@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu - Univerisity of Illinois	Does it do it to all tapes?  Were the two tapes that it unwound of the same	type from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapes	that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and	had closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.	Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?	If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of	the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.	As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more	than you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes in	the tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is	at the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My best	guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second	marker?	Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tape	is clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  The	tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where	the reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects the	light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirty	or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have	a problem detecting the end of the tape.	If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then either	the pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you open	the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W head	assembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive may	need to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensor	is out.	If it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS for	repair.	---	Scott Hiles	whiles@relay.nswc.navy.mil	Standard disclaimer:	The opinions expressed are those of my own and do not necessarily	reflect those of the DOD or the Navy.

Well, my 14inch VGA 1024x758-interlacing 2.5 year old no brand monitor just	bit the bullet. I pressed the power switch and a few seconds later, the power	light went out with a POP. Gawd, it's only been two and half years.	How long would normal monitors last? I think the problem with my monitor is	the power switch... but the image was getting pretty dim anyway (I needed to	have my contrast all the way to the max...). And the screen did flicker from	time to time. Is this normal (hehehe) or do I just have the worst of luck???	Question: What do I do now???? Buy a new one? Get it fixed? Save up for a	*really* good one and get by with a cheap EGA monitor for now? I rather save	my money to upgrade my 386SX to 486-66 though...

Having been both a service technician, and a service manager, at a	ComputerLand franchise and another retail computer place, I know what	I'm talking about.	I also know the "local service" scam that retail computer dealers like	to push when they're selling.  It's that same old song that car dealers	having been singing for years -- "Buy from me and you'll get good	service. We always treat our customers right!  Buy from my competition	and you'll be sorry if you need service."	Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order	companies that give excellent service, including overnight replacement parts,	on-site calls, etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give you	good service, too. But if you think all local dealers give consistenly good	service, you are wrong.  I have many anectdotes to prove my point,	but I'm sure there are others on the net can do a better job than I can.	- Ted Drude (tbdrude@infonode.ingr.com)

Today (Tueday 4-6-93) IBM is supposed to officially announce the introduction	of the VESA Local Bus Value Point systems.  These systems still have on-board	video and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems, and	you get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three of	them with 17" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three will	immediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller and	either the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board.	Do not buy a 486SX sytem.	My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  When	you earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they	get you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but large	steps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SX	models and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models.	Gordon

I can tell you that mixing them	between 'banks' ok, and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless	they are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in one	bank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming that	the SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalent	configuration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bit	nibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte	).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalent	because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMM	interface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry	if too techie for ya].

If my system supports	MG>> of 8 MEG (it has 8 SIMM slots), can I plug in 4 4MB SIMMs to give my	MG>> 16MB ??	That sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit	wide SIMMs, you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  Why you ask?	Simple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bit	CPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data	from memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when	it asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard	links 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that in	this simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That means	that a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If you	have a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit wide	data, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banks	are 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data	with 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade by	one SIMM at a time.	Hope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your	question was not simple.  I could of just said, 'because I said so.'	-rdd	---	. WinQwk 2.0b#0 .

Phone support is quick and competent from many mail order firms, but not so	quick and not so competent from others (Gateway included).  But my experience	with computer retailers (which is significant) has lead to the conclusion that	sales personnel and retail-technical personnel are forbidden to actually learn	about the products they sell.

Retail outlets are desirable, however, to those people who aren't interested	in learning about computers enough to make their own decisions.  This is fine;	for example most of my education about carpeting, wall paper, lawn mowers,	microwave ovens, etc. has come from sales personnel.  I assume I must be an	idiot.  But I don't care about those things.  I do, however, care about my	computer - i.e. I demand features and performance, and I'll be damned if I'll	pay some high-school drop out commission on an over-rated, over-priced system	and in the process be subjected to his distorted B.S.

You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are not	right.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables	are on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving it	to the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.	The narrow data cable goes to J2.

WD1004A-27X, feature F300R - Half-slot size hard disk	controller  with an ST506/ST412 interface.  It supports 2 RLL	drives with up to 16 heads and 1024 cylinders.  Built-in ROM	BIOS supports non-standard drive types, virtual drive	formatting, bad track formatting and dynamic formatting.	NOTE 1:  AT&T 6300 - The AT&T 6300 and the AT&T 6300 PLUS	contain system BIOS chips that support the hard disk drive.	When using a Western Digital XT controller card the system will	not "boot."  To solve this problem, one of the ROM BIOS chips	must be disabled.  To disable the BIOS on your Western Digital	XT controller card, you must remove the jumper at position W-3	or add a jumper at position R-23 (depending on which model of XT	controller you are using).	-2-	NOTE 2:  TANDY 1000 SYSTEMS - The WD1002A-WX1, WD1004A-WX1,	WDXT-GEN2 and the WD1004-27X can be modified to operate in	Tandy 1000 series computers, models SX, TX and the original or	"A" version.  These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2)	instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 or	the WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut the	etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Then	solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete the	modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1	(2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATION	TO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTY	ON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or the	WD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must	be soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change the	interrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.

Thanks.	A program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the	msdos/keyboard directory will do this.  It is written in assembler and it	best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map.  It is possible,	however, to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard	driver if you do not have a compiler.  I used hexed100.zip, also available	on simtel.  Simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning	of the "normal" keyboard map.  Then swap the codes for the keys that you	wish to swap.  See the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report	the scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info).

Since I've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding Gateways	lately on here, I thought I post my recent pleasant experiences. My	machine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY from	when I called the order in.	Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All the	peripherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). I	was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gateway	documentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals.	The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP came	with build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office)	was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box and	has been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardly	even reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has a	lot to do with it.	It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read about	some people having problems with high speed serial communications.	I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my old	computer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then "maps" the other	machines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can "cd" to these	drives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like a	peer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine.	It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and this	machine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from the	peer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive.	My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I also	by-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430	credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!	So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad it	was me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-)	John	--	John Gayman, WA3WBU	UUCP: uunet!wa3wbu!john	Packet: WA3WBU @ WB3EAH

I was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem I am having with	my Gateway 2000 486-33DX VL-Bus system with ATI Graphics Ultra Pro LB.	When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600, everything is	fine, but whenever I use it in 800x600 (Windows, AutoCAD, GIFs) the screen	gets about 1 1/2 inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screen	there is about a 3/4" bar of black.  The screen isn't cut off, it just squeezes	everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I can	manually change the V-Size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it just	shouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven't	been able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card, and	both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even tried	to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of	days, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks	before billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story...	So, if anyone has had this same problem, please let me know if you know what	to do.  Hell, let me know if you don't have a solution, just so I know I'm	not the only one with this problem.  Thanks in advance.	Jude M. Greer	jmgree01@starbase.spd.louisville.edu	P.S.  I already tried going into the MACH 32 install program and manually set-	ting up the card.  Doesn't work.  Whenever I try to increase the vertical size	of the 800x600 screen, it just starts to cut off the top and bottom.

Nntp-Posting-Host: hpmpec3c.cup.hp.com	X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8.10]	First of all, thanks to those of you who responded, both here and via e-mail.	The tips didn't pan out, but it was good hearing from you.	Now, following up to my earlier post:	[...]	: Disk controller:  Acculogic sIDE-3 2 hard/2 floppy IDE controller	:   Jumpers:  All defaulted (shown as *):	:     Normal IRQ*/delayed IRQ     Primary*/secondary floppy address	:     Single*/dual speed floppy   Primary*/secondary IDE address	:     Precomp = 125ns*/187 ns     IOCHRDY not driven*/IDE drive controls IOCHRDY	[...]	: Other cards:  (didn't check brand) 2 Serial/1 Parallel adapter	: 	      Logitech Bus Mouse adapter	: 	      Roland MPU-401-compatible MIDI interface	: 		Configured with default IRQ 2, mem address 0330	I opened up the box and removed all the "other cards" above.  No help there.	Then, not having anything better to try, I changed Normal IRQ to Delayed	IRQ on the disk controller (didn't make any difference) and IOCHRDY_not_	driven to IDE_drive_controls_IOCHRDY (also had no effect).  So I put	everything back to the way it was and re-installed the cards.	I then unplugged the floppy drive cable from the disk controller.  Voila!,	the PC booted from power up, although it seemed to take several seconds	before the first access to the hard disk.  Plug the floppy cable back	to the controller and the original (non-boot) behavior returns.	O.K., with this additional information, does anyone in netland have any	words of wisdom for what's going on and how I should deal with it?	-Larry "still (un)plugging away" Byler-

Howdy,	Sorry if this has been covered before:	One of my PC illiterate friends asked me to help him install DRDOS 6.0 on his	NEC Powermate SX (386SX 16).  Of course, I said "No problem" and went to work.	Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive during	installation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive using	the old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bit	Seagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then booted	with DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if	I could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partition	was intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn't think you could go over a	32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then tried	to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I am	unaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (I	kinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOS	installations).  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for	"Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC")...	Thanks in advance,	Paul "Mr. SCSI... NOT!" Fincke

Herman, I would think you of all people would/could distinguish	between "health" and "treatment of disease." All the prevention	medicine people preach this all the time. You cannot buy health.	You can buy treatment of disease, assuming you are lucky enough	to have a disease which can be treated. A rich person with a	terminal disease is a bit out of luck. There is no such thing	as "adequately covered" and there never will be.	And for what it's worth, I'll be the first to admit that all my	patients die.	-km

Recurrent Volvulus	-------------------	This is regarding recurrent volvulus which our little boy	has been suffering from ever since he was an infant. He had	a surgery when he was one year old. Another surgery had	to be performed one year after, when he was two years old.	He turned three this February and he is still getting	afflicted by this illness, like having to get hospitalised	for vomitting and accompanying stomach pain.He managed	not having a third surgery so far.	*  	One thing me and my wife noticed is that his affliction	peaks around the time he was born, on nearabouts, like in	March every year.  Any significance to this?	*	Why does this recur? Me and my family go through severe pain	when our little boy have to undergo surgery. Why does surgery	not rectify the situation?	*	Also, which hospital in US or Canada specialize in this malady?	*	What will be a good book explaining this disease in detail?	*	Will keeping a particular diet keep down the probability of	recurrence?	*	As time goes on, will the probability of recurrence go down	considering he is getting stronger and healthier and probably	less prone to attacks? Or is this assumption wrong?	*	Any help throwing light on these queries will be highly appreciated.	Thanks very much!	jose@csd.uwo.ca

The differential diagnosis between migraine and non-migranous pain	is not *always* important, because some therapies are effective in	both (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline,	non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen).  Other	therapies may be more specific: beta-blockers such as propranolol	work better in migraine than tension-type headache.	The most important thing, from your perspective, is that you got	relief.  Also, please understand that a diagnosis other than	migraine does not necessarily mean "psychogenic"; I suspect that	organic factors play as large a role in tension-type headache as in	migraine.	---	.

On one hand you state that "things have changed dramatically" but, at the	same time nothing you "can think of has changed".  Your girlfriend seems	to want to see a counselor, but you don't.	I'd recommend that you examine your hesitation to see a counselor.  It's	a very good environment to examine issues.	The fact of the matter is:  your girlfriend has a different perception than	you.

A friend of mine is going in later this week for tests to see if has	emphysema.  His lung capacity has decreased over time.  His father died	of the disease.  He works in woodworking.  I believe he has a very	occasional cigarette, perhaps one cigarette a day or even less.  He tells	me this..I've never seen him light up.  He has some pretty healthy	life style habits, good diet, exercise, meditation, retreats, therapy	etc.  Anyhow..he is very concerned with this check up.  I know really	nothing about the disease.  I believe it interferes with the lining	of the lung being able to exchange oxygen.	Is a diagnosis of emphysema a death sentence?  If he were to give up smoking	entirely would that better his chances for recovery?  What are some	modern therapies used in people with this disease?  I would appreciate	any information.  Thanks.  amigan@cup.portal.com

Thanks to all those who responded to my original post on this question.  The	final diagnosis was Stress.  I did not take her for a chiropractic adjustment.	(Rachel receives all her medical care at Keller Army Hospital since she is a	military dependant, and the Army does not yet provide chiropractic adjustments	as part of its regular health care.)  I am hoping that the arrival of (1)	Spring Break, and (2) College Acceptance Letters, will help.  *UNFORTUNATELY*	she was wait-listed at the college she most dearly wanted to attend, so it	seems as though that stressor may just continue for a while.  :-(	Meanwhile she is going on a camping trip with her religious youth group for	spring break, which seems like a good stress-reliever to me.	Thanks again for everybody's help/advice/suggestions/ideas.	------------------------	Ruth Ginzberg <rginzberg@eagle.wesleyan.edu>	Philosophy Department;Wesleyan University;USA

Getting back to the original question in this thread:	I experienced breathing difficulties a few years ago similar to those	described.  In my case, it turned out that I was developing Type I	diabetes.  Although I never sought direct confirmation of this from my	doctor, I think that the breathing problem was associated with the	presence of ketones due to the diabetes.	I think that ketosis can occur in lesser degree if one is restricting	their food intake drastically.  I don't know if this relevant in this	case, but you might ask your daughter if she has been eating	properly.	--	Steve Kirchoefer                                             (202) 767-2862	Code 6851                                      kirchoefer@estd.nrl.navy.mil	Naval Research Laboratory                       Microwave Technology Branch	Washington, DC  20375-5000              Electronics Sci. and Tech.

They aren't designed, they evolved.  And, much as it discomforts us, in	humans a trouble-free birth process was sacrificed to increased brain and	cranial size.  Wild animals have a much easier time with birth than humans do.	Domestic horses and cows typically have a worse time.  To give you an idea:	my family tree is complicated because a few of my pioneer great-great-	grandfathers had several wives, and we never could figure out which wife	had each child.  One might ask why this happened.  My great-great-	grandfathers were, by the time they reached their forties, quite prosperous	farmers.  Nonetheless, they lost several wives each to the rigors of	childbirth; the graveyards in Spencer, Indiana, and Boswell, North Dakota,	contain quite a few gravestones like "Ida, wf. of Jacob Liptrap, and	baby, May 6, 1853."	>You wanted	>to section all women carrying breech in case one in a hundred or a	>thousand breech babies get hung up in second stage,	More like one in ten.  And the consequences can be devastating; I have	direct experience of more than a dozen victims of a fouled-up breech birth.	>and now you want	>all babies born in hospital based on a guess of how likely maternal	>hemorrhage is and a false belief that it is fatal.	It isn't always fatal.  But it is often fatal, when it happens out of	reach of adequate help.  More often, it permanently damages one's health.	Clearly women's bodies _evolved_ to give birth (I am no believer in divine	design); however, evolution did not favor trouble-free births for humans.	>You have your kids where you want. You encourage your wife to	>get six inch holes cut through her stomach muscles, expose herself	>to anesthesia and infection, and whatever other "just in case" measures	>you think are necessary.	My, aren't we wroth!  I haven't read a more outrageous straw man attack	in months!  I can practically see your mouth foam.	We're statistically sophisticated enough to balance the risks.  Although	I can't produce exact statistics 5 years after the last time we looked	them up, rest assured that we balanced C-section risks against other risks.	I wouldn't encourage my wife to have a Caesarean unless it was clearly	indicated; on the other hand, I am opposed (on obvious grounds) to waiting	until an emergency to give in.	And bear this in mind: my wife took the lead in all of these decisions.	We talked things over, and I did a lot of the leg work, but the main	decisions were really hers.	>But I for one am bothered by your continued	>suggestions, especially to the misc.kidders pregnant for the first	>time, that birth is dangerous, even fatal, and that all these	>unpleasant things are far better than the risks you run just doing	>it naturally.

But for heaven's sake, not everyone needs that!	But people should bother to find out the relative risks.  My wife was	unwilling to take any significant risks in order to have nice surroundings.	In view of the intensity of the birth experience, I doubt surroundings	have much importance anyway.  Somehow the values you're advocating seem	all lopsided to me: taking risks, even if fairly small, of serious	permanent harm in order to preserve something that is, after all,	an esthetic consideration.	--	Mark A.

My 14-y-o son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose.  I	bought him Clearasil face wash and ointment.  I think that is probably	enough, along with the usual good diet.  However, he is on at me to	get some product called Dalacin T, which used to be a	doctor's-prescription only treatment but is not available over the	chemist's counter.  I have asked a couple of pharmacists who say	either his acne is not severe enough for Dalacin T, or that Clearasil	is OK.  I had the odd spots as a teenager, nothing serious.  His	father was the same, so I don't figure his acne is going to escalate	into something disfiguring.  But I know kids are senstitive about	their appearance.  I am wary because a neighbour's son had this wierd	malady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin A from	acne treatment.  I want to help - but with appropriate treatment.	My son also has some scaliness around the hairline on his scalp.  Sort	of teenage cradle cap.  Any pointers/advice on this?  We have tried a	couple of anti dandruff shampoos and some of these are inclined to	make the condition worse, not better.

The cockpit	crew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew	limits for this reason.  Crew rest requirements address amount of time	on duty plus rest time.  A tired crew is an accident-prone crew.	The only limits I know of for inner-ear problems are in military	aircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably	pressurized.  Not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members	DNIF (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear.	Flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear.  If you don't have	big pressure changes, you may not know that you've got a problem.  But	if you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an	airliner) and then back down to sea level, you may discover a problem.	Ears don't clear readily because of allergies, colds, infections, and	anatomical problems.  The last won't change; the first three can.	Medication (decongestants or antihistimines, usually) can help.	Chewing gum, sucking hard candy (or a bottle for babies),	yawning--these will help all four causes.	--	Mary Shafer  DoD #0362 KotFR NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility, Edwards, CA	shafer@rigel.dfrf.nasa.gov                    Of course I don't speak for NASA	"A MiG at your six is better than no MiG at all."

And also better, because a neurologist can make a differential	diagnosis between migraine, tension-type headache, cluster, benign	intracranial hypertension, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, and other	headache syndromes that all appear normal on a scan.  A neurologist	can also recommend a course of treatment that is appropriate to the	diagnosis.

Even	after I try to show thoroughness with a detailed history, neurologic	examination, and discussion with the patient about my diagnosis,	salted with lots of reassurance, patients still ask "why can't you	order a scan, so we can be absolutely sure?"  Aunt Millie often gets	into the conversation, as in "they ignored Aunt Millie's headaches	for years", and then she died of a brain tumor, aneurysm, or	whatever.  If you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a	patient with an obviously benign headache syndrome, I'd like to hear	what your magic is.	Every once in a while I am able to bypass imaging by getting an EEG.	Mind you, I don't think EEG is terribly sensitive for brain tumor,	but the patient feels like "something is being done" (as if the	hours I spent talking with and examining the patient were	"nothing"), the EEG has no ionizing radiation, it's *much* cheaper	than CT or MRI, and the EEG brings in some money to my department.	---	.

Adding layers of managers and bureaucrats simply eat up	money that could be spent on those who actually are doing the work	such as doctors and nurse, and supplies.  The most efficient system	is probably one that has limited management and a fixed budget such	as England's or even Canada's.  I'm afraid we are on the wrong	track.

Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Taking	anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea	of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted,	additional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are	not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that	in a given situation the risk is worthwhile.	Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in	some cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn't been in use	that long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have	when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested	by present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market because	long-term effects, if any, are not known?  IMHO, i'd say no.	euclid	>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=	>=  Kenneth Gilbert                |          University of Pittsburgh   =	>=  General Internal Medicine    --*--        Pittsburgh, PA             =	>=  kxgst1+@pitt.edu               |      "...dammit, not a programmer!  =	>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=	>--	>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=	>=  Kenneth Gilbert                |          University of Pittsburgh   =	>=  General Internal Medicine    --*--        Pittsburgh, PA             =	>=  kxgst1+@pitt.edu               |      "...dammit, not a programmer!  =	--	Euclid K.       standard disclaimers apply	"It is a bit ironic that we need the wave model [of light] to understand the	propagation of light only through that part of the system where it leaves no	trace."  --Hudson & Nelson (_University_Physics_)

If this	is what it is, she'll probably get used to it.  It would keep me up	and drive me nuts too, but nowadays, I have to plug both my ears with	my fingers to check to see if they are ringing.  Usually they are, but	you get so used to it, it just gets tuned out.  Yes, this is what I've	read about it... not just from my own personal experience.	>Does anyone know of any treatments for this?

You just learn to cope	with it (like I mentioned earlier) by ignoring it.  It eventually	becomes unconscious.	The doc also said it could be caused by diet (ie: too much caffeine)	and stress, but I haven't changed my lifestyle much, and it just comes	and goes (it is always there somewhat, but now I rarely notice it when	it really "kicks in").	Also, it doesn't necessarily mean there is any hearing loss, either	caused by it or causing it.  I had an ENT (ear/nose/throat) exam, and	passed.  In fact, my hearing is quite good considering I don't take as	good of care of my hearing as I should.	Her reaction is normal.  If it is tinnitus, chances are good she'll	begin to not even notice it.	This info is taken mostly from a few "experts", my own experience, and	some readings (sorry, it was a few years back and don't have any	specifics handy).	JT

As I understand, these are all short term.	I second what Spenser Aden said in reply.  Additionally, it is hard to say	what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say	how long you have been on it.  Patients are generally kept on steroids for	months before thinking about tapering.  Alternatives to daily dosing are	every other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start.	Another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start	azathioprine.  Like Spenser said, you should generally be on another drug	in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  A lot of the specifics	about options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of	disease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it	is worth.	I treat patients with UC and Crohn's.  An educated patient is a good	patient, but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things	can be put in context.  You should also be a member of the Crohn's and	Colitis Foundation of America.  1-800-932-2423 office / 1-800-343-3637	info hotline.	Best of Luck to you.	Steve Holland.	gila005@uabdpo.dpo.uab.edu

A very simple question : it seems to me that the contraceptive	pill just prevents the ovule to nest in the vagina and forces it to	fall every month. But it does not prevent the fertilzation of the	ovule. Is it true ? If yes, is there a risk of extra-uterine	pregnancy, that is the development of the ovule inside the Fallopian	tube ?

The answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer without	doing a lot of autopsies.  The second question is something that's been	known for some time.  It appears that within about 15 years of quitting	smoking a person's risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the	person who never smoked (assuming you do not get lung cancer in the	interim!).  The risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per	day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non-smoker.  Still	rather low overall, but significant.  Personally, I'd be more concerned	about heart disease secondary to smoking -- it's much more common, and	even a small increase in risk is significant there.	--	=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=	=  Kenneth Gilbert              __|__        University of Pittsburgh   =	=  General Internal Medicine      |      "...dammit, not a programmer!  =	=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-|-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

I had a moderate	acne problem for many years.  I then found that if I vigorously scrub my face	with a nail brush and soap (Irish Spring) twice a day the acne was not a	problem.  I can still leave a pretty health nose print on a mirror after 45 min	(don't ask ;->) but acne is not a real problem anymore.	[J.F.]

NNTP-Posting-Host: ouchem.chem.oakland.edu	Sumatriptan(Imitrex) just became available in the US in a subcutaneous	injectable form.  Is there an oral form available in CA?  A friend(yes	really not me!)  has severe migranes about 2-3 times per week.  We	live right by the CA border and he has gotten drugs for GERD prescribed	by a US physician and filled in a CA pharmacy, but not yet FDA approved	in the US.  What would be the cost of the oral form in CA$ also if	anyone would have that info?	Thanks

A friend has the following symptoms which have occurred periodically	every few months for the last 3 years.  An episode begins with extreme	tiredness followed by:	1. traveling joint pains and stiffness affecting mostly the elbows,	knees, and hips.	2. generalized muscle pains	3. tinnitus and a feeling of pressure in her ears	4. severe sweating occuring both at night and during the day	5. hemorrhaging in both eyes.  Her opthamologist calls it peripheral	retinal hemorhages and says it looks similar to diabetic retinopathy.  (She	isn't diabetic--they checked.	6. distorted color vision and distorted vision in general (telephone	poles do not appear to be straight)	7. loss of peripheral vision.	Many tests have been run and all are normal except for something	called unidentified bright objects found on a MRI of her brain.  The only	thing that seems to alleviate one of these episodes is prednisone.  At	times she had been on 60 mg per day.  Whenever she gets down to 10-15 mg	the symptoms become acute again.	She is quite concerned because the retinal hemorrhages are becoming	worse with each episode and her vision is suffering.  None of the docs she	has seen have any idea what this condition is or what can be done to stop	it.  Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in	advance.  Kathy Turner

The HumBio Project:  Call for Data and Visualizations	The HumBio Project is a CD-ROM-based curriculum tool for sixth-, seventh-, and	eigth-graders, studying the function of the human brain and the effects of	neurotransmitters, alcohol, and drugs.  The will be a special focus in depicting	the effects of neurotransmitters on behavior.	Volotta Interactive Video is producing this project for Stanford University.	We are currently in a pre-production phase and we are looking for data sets and	visualizations depicting brain function on the whole brain, neuron and molecular	levels.  We intend to use state-of-the-art visualization tools to render	instructive visualizations from two-, three-, and four-dimensional data sets as	well as using already-completed visualizations to their best effect.	If you're interested in sharing your data for the purpose of education and	supporting the introductions of CD-ROM and scientific visualization technologies	into our schools, please e-mail phughes@igc.org.  Include your name,	organization, and type and format of data you might be willing to provide.  We	are eager to begin production in the next few months and will be excited to hear	from you.

Take an example from	someone like Brendan McKay, with whom I don't agree, but who uses logic and	documentation to argue his position.  Why must you insist on constantly spouting	baseless lies?  You may piss some people off, but that's about it.  You won't	prove anything or add anything worthy to a discussion.  Your arguments just	prove what a poor debater you are and how weak your case really is.	All my love,	Ed.

[It looks like Yigal has been busy...]	RTw  04/14 2155  JEWISH GROUP SUED FOR PASSING OFFICIAL INFORMATION	By Adrian Croft	SAN FRANCISCO, April 14, Reuter - Nineteen people, including the son of	former Israeli Defence Minister Moshe Arens, sued the Anti-Defamation League	(ADL) on Wednesday, accusing the Jewish group of disclosing confidential	official information about them.	Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, art	dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as defendants	in the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.	The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fighting	anti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on	them, including data from state and federal agencies.	The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the	governments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a "a massive	spying operation."	The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000	anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the	plaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.	Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available	for comment on Wednesday.	The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that	Gerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed	confidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.	The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and	Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco	and Los Angeles.	The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California,	which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources.	It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as other	unspecified damages.	Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the	plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and his	wife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.	One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the	University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence	Minister.	Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on	him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of	Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.	According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both	kept information on thousands of California political activists.	In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid	Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and	Bullock received confidential information from the authorities.	No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and	Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing.	REUTER AC KG CM	APn  04/14 2202  ADL Lawsuit	Copyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.	By CATALINA ORTIZ	Associated Press Writer	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arab-Americans and critics of Israel sued the	Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday, saying it invaded their privacy by	illegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network.	The ADL, a national group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, intended to	use the data to discredit them because of their political views, according to	the class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court.	"None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti-Semitism or hate	crimes, or any of the other `isms' that the ADL claims to protect against. None	of us is violent or criminal in any way," said Carol El-Shaieb, an education	consultant who develops programs on Arab culture.	The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense Minister	Moshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University of	Southern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably	because he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians.	"The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks	politically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite," Arens said.	The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuit	because it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL's New York	headquarters.	The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that	the ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including	white supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace,	the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco	public television station KQED.	Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government	records, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit.	No charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.	The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law, which	forbids the intentional disclosure of personal information "not otherwise	public" from state or federal records.	The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to "persons and	entities" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn't elaborate.	Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL's office in San	Francisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.	Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock, an alleged ADL	informant over the past four decades, and former police officer Tom Gerard.	Gerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed	information on to Bullock.	Gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the Philippines.	Bullock's lawyer, Richard Breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuit	because he had not yet studied it.	UPwe 04/14 1956  ADL sued for allegedly spying on U.S. residents	SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) -- A group of California residents filed suit Wednesday	charging the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith with violating their privacy	by spying on them for the Israeli and South African governments.	The class-action suit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, charges the ADL	and its leadership conspired with a local police official to obtain information	on outspoken opponents of Israeli policies towards the Occupied Territories and	South Africa's apartheid policy.	The ADL refused to comment on the suit.	The suit also took aim at two top local ADL officials and retired San	Francicso police officer Tom Gerard, claiming they violated privacy guarantees	in the state constitution and violated state confidentiality laws.	According to the suit, Gerard helped the ADL obtain access to confidential	files in law enforcement and government computers. Information from these files	were passed to the foreign governments, the suit charges.	"The whole concept of an organized collection of information based on	political viewpoints and using government agencies as a source of information is	absolutely repugnant," said former Rep. Pete McCloskey, who is representing the	plaintiffs.	The ADL's information-gathering network was revealed publicly last week when	the San Francisco District Attorney's Office released documents indicating the	group had spied on 12,000 people and 500 political and ethnic groups for more	than 30 years.	"My understanding is that they (the ADL) consider all activity that is in	some sense opposed to Israel or Israeli action to be part of their responsbility	to investigate," said Arens, a research scientist at the University of Southern	California.	"The ADL believes that anyone who is Arab American...or speaks politically	against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite."	The FBI and the District Attorney's Office have been investigating the	operation for four months.	The 19 plaintiffs in the case include Arens, the son of former Israeli	Defense Minister Moshe Arens.	In a press release, the plaintiffs said the alleged spying had damaged them	psychologically and economically and accused the ADL of trying to interfere with	their freedom of speech.

Just trying to get this clear, so please bear with me.  As far as	I can tell, you're proposing the following rules of engagement	between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feel	revise this preliminary draft as necessary:	1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform	or out, on duty or off.  In practice, since any male or female	Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but	young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of	Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further	provocation is required.	2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant	Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans	without positive identification as military personnel, clear	indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.	a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for	Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively	military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or	self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note	that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,	AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive	military identification and require closer inspection such	as document checks.	b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent,	which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less	than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals	of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a	single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,	as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.	As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to	originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify	armed response.	c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive	military identification of all personnel in the target area of	the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not	be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft	are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the	papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously	civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of	uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov	coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to	land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should	first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.	For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters	is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated	if necessary.	--- D. C.

[1]	Born 1964	Secretary-Typist	Azsantekmontazh Trust	Sumgait Construction and Installation Administration	Secretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization	Resident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15	Microdistrict No. 3	Sumgait [Azerbaijan]	On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show,	at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards	away. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, "The Abyss."	Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at	the City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversation	whatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it	was about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if	someone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. There	were 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that	large movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the	film. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well	mostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an	Armenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that	they were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do	to Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demanded	a girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move	over, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone	recognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina.	It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it's	only opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats.	Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis,	people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the	auditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and	gradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, "OK, we've	scared them enough, let's leave." They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to	me that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of	"anasha", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like	they were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing	had happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful	films which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We	could barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine,	and it was dark . . .	Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. Lenin	Street was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting,	something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especially	listening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going to	make it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation	wasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police,	policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the	doors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors	there are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-	stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some	naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well,	since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super	serious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we	live literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it was	dark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the	driver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and	he said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well,	OK . . .	So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was	happening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation	was at a standstill and everyone was shouting "Ka-ra-bagh," they're not going	to give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there's	immediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had	come, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed to	cheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,	just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma	down. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though	nothing had happened.	That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere and	didn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.	That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn't	guess.	On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always	had. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda,	Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and	no one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that	morning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at	home and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda	Zimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we did	our apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that something	awful was happening in town. I asked, "Don't they want Armenians? Well what	are they after, if they're already in that state?" She says, no, nothing like	that, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels	like a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The	cabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.	Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy	problems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,	asked him, "Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going	on in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?" Papa didn't know what she	was talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home	and told Mamma. Mamma said, "Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means	that something is really going on." But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian,	she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock I	tell Lyuda, "Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll see	you out." Mamma says, "You don't need to go, it's too late already, you can	see what the situation in town is." So we decided to stay home. Dinner was	ready. Mamma says, "Let her eat with us, then she can go." We sat down at the	table. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything	out on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating.	We turned on the television, and the show "In Fairy-Tale Land" was coming on.	We cleared the table.	We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can't	see what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus	station, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people	. . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, looking	somewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she's	an Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down	to look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story	buildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20	people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see	several people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide	that means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're not	killing anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of	the soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their	feet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in	general terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak	. . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .	If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him	and started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if he	got up and left or not.	I become terrified and go home and say, "Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at our	place, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . " Then the crowd	runs over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and	starts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors	are also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is	shouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it	turns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and	kept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stop	them.	They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,	afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the	windows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard,	and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don't	crush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a huge	cloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey	Sargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear	tramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous	din and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were	shouting Father's name, "Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!," or	something like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma	says, "Into the bedroom, quickly!" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part	of our dowry; Mamma says, "Hide there, they probably won't come in there,	they'll ask something, say something, and leave." She says, "We'll tell them	that we live alone here." I can't imagine that my parents will stand out in	the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say	that I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe I	can find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak	Azerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and	Lyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I told	her anything or not.	Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fell	right into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,	leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I	tell them, "What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what	has happened." In Azerbaijani, they say, "Get out of the apartment, leave." I	say, "OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave the	apartment." I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with	them, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the	doorway, the young guys, say, "There are old people and one girl with them.	Too bad!" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have	pacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts,	commanding them: "Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?"	And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one	room, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start	undressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there,	in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or how	much time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,	and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. The	atrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among	themselves who would go first.	Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comes	in, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding.	He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. It	seems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything	depends on him. He looks and says, "Well, we're done here." They are beating	Mamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs	. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . was	out cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get the	window open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the	windows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking	about being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strong	person anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, that	I'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be,	which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they	don't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would I	humble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since my	tongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing	. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.	I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don't	know if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by	my arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings,	something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone	else is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will death	come? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near	the entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What	happened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.	I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me	clothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember	that I said the same words over and over again: "Mamma, what happened, Mamma,	what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?" I can't make	sense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he	served in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all	went to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his	courage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even though	he's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he	served in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served	there, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor	brought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying,	"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them." How do I know who's who	and what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then	Papa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when	they dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda	said that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching the	Russians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's going	to tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda's	hands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our	sister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts pounding	on the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in	there. So they survived.	My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.	While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back	up again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed	there. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put	it on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, the	one whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and	knocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, "I'm not going to let you	in the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockings	and we'll leave the building." Lyuda says, "I'll stay at your place because of	what's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs." It was just for a	moment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda came	back to our place and lay under the bed . . .	I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephone	number, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he	came to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we were	simply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passed	between life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.	There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly,	it was hard to breathe . . .	My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of our	administration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number	of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary	passenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right	after eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a	great many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and	what was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not	only in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next,	without stopping. After us.	I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from	Buildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died	from Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There young	Azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building.	Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relatives	to warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in	Microdistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, "Run	quickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stay	alive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away." At that moment	three people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such	awful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up,	there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything	out of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face	was pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my	normal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to	scream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you	here, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of	the soldiers said, "Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from the	Sumgait police. They called in from Daghestan." So at that point the	Daghestan police were there.	When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,	there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know,	maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously	injured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what they	were there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda	and me and said, "These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don't	know what to do with the rest."	So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My	boss said, "Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matter	what happens." We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department	head from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She	examined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait	ambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. People	called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.	That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something	very good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself,	"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?" She looks me over and	says, "Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have been	doing, your people did even worse things." And I think, great, I have to deal	with her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not to	have to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this	condition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn't	have the energy to say, "How could our people possibly be smart enough to	think of something that yours haven't already done?" I stayed there. Then they	brought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her	own apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next	morning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. This	was in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anything	more than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer,	nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look at	them.	I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-	pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That	same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face	was disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, "Better to ask	your brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother can	better explain what happened." She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw	themselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my	ward.	Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me	clothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress,	but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up	above my knees, and the woman orderly said, "I can't believe you put on such a	short dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?" I went back to my	ward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and	brought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I	couldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said	that I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No one	had to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . .	Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should	be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an	Armenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they must	have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something	else would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on	the street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.	The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus,	and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me to	the club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.	I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many	troops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw	a few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought	that I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait	after that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn't	come to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine.	I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm	me down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw	a lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each	other and asking, "What happened, what went on?" Two days later they came to	see me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed	interest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they	could. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues	who didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions,	neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what	happened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart	. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came,	not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part	of, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements	with the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by	myself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my	lungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I	lay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be	from all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular.	When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of	insisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful.	There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they took	me there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were	emergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina's	friends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic.	They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I	needed at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty	breathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.	They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some	people saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all	bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I	wasn't cut.	They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon	appeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not	talk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, "We	demand that Seidov come!" The response was, "It's Seidov who sent us." Seidov	is the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said,	"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the same	things to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with you	agitators." And so on. More of them said, "Have Seidov himself come." This	went on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us	out of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because	they realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The	smell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who	had literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a	club that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay	to eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day	someone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.	Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie	theater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, it	was impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants	took ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in	Yerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to	mention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting	right and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only	the young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women	were in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come	any minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered	together purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie	theater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to	the attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and	couldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently	they caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the	theater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open my	eyes.	Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, "Aren't you an	Azerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani." They	led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their	passports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did	not have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in	nothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like	they should have, with their IDs.	So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On	Monday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn't	spare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,	they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered	the Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-	in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only	the two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself,	she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about the	building until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children.	This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were	already in the city.	They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire	families. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armenians	or not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn't	see any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficult	now to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identify	the corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in	gasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heard	that many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people,	including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in	Microdistrict 3.	They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who	had been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were	going home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply	savagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did	what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that	hoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians	out and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that they	put them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from	the corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from the	ashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira	G., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and	she still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and	beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that	whole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and	carried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.	I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of	people went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a	song in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has	that piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song,	the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They	couldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment and	called the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,	she couldn't remember anyone's face.	I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had	talked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked	out of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw	the Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. She	goes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at	the Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm the	Secretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met	with the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint	meetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is from	Armenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of	those people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.	They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the	Procuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-	tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They	showed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on our	case, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they were	the ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that	someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were	dragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch	me, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these	people, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they were	all from Kafan.	The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was	there when everything started. It must have been him because I didn't	recognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since	I told him, "Listen, you do something, because you know me." He turned away	and went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marina	anyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make out	anyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became	myself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people	there. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his	name. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one	we're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, "If	he's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his	alibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, not	responsible for my words." He said, "What did they do to you, how awful,	myself, I hid an Armenian family." Then after some time goes by he comes back	again and says something entirely different: "I wasn't at home, my family and	I went to Baku." I said, "Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally	different before." After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case is	being handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me	that Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved.	What are they doing with Rzayev?	Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the	head I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an	insult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at the	same time	I'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-	ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that one	wasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what	exactly I can't say.	When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it,	because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got	it because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it	always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my	face I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed,	they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he	works at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41,	is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ	dormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they even	have proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the	clarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our	building was killed, it was that man.	A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that	he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't come	over, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was	all over, people started making announcements in town saying that	investigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now	they've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've been	beating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but he	himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy	came to the plant and said, "Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the	bus station on Saturday at ten." That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,	went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday	night. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do	you mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent,	probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn't	say anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go,	because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had	killed their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of	that. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that	the Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from	I've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied with	them thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word	I said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an	Armenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know.	His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from	Microdistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time.	His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani	KGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many	photographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at	curfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this,	the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off	and burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a	haystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he	is so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did,	I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment.	At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this,	all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a look	at him and thought, "My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like	you." But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything	without great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when	she came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over	the table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the	balcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had	all kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters.	They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that	moment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the	faces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the	apartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids and	no place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't have	anywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the	apartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the	apartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did they	know there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that	Armenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the	building, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis	lived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to our	apartment.	I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt	when I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would	have said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but	probably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw	that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at	a free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were	being fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have	been fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from	our building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, "Karina, we	saw all of it, how could it happen?" They're asking me! Well I just don't know	what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to	me. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have been	able to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani	woman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated	woman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two	Armenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the	balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She	came down to the entryway and said, "You'll come in this entryway over my dead	body." So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some	folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn't	even know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very well	what they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. They	couldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani	stopped them.	They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place	they were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the	apartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that?	Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it is	some kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed	to be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had	come to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They	didn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They	screamed and screamed: "Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!"	Only they didn't shout "kill," they shouted "gurun ermianlary." Gurun	literally means "kill," or "destroy."	That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's an	Azerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their	kids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part	of the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't find	Lyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,	but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently	they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the	courage to . . .	A boy said to my mother "Where's the gold?" Mamma said he must have been 12	to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the	Azerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the	fair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where	the gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a	little black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like to	wear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were	bought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma	thinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and	Mamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth,	bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had	shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and	tore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having	trouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and	started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted	to open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by	accident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake,	"What's happened?" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, "At least go and	find out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them or	murdered them, at least bring the corpses." He went looking for us. At that	moment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that	someone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get out	from under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought	she was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to	herself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from	under the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost	her mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that	way to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled	down, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from	outside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order it	happened in.	And Mamma said, "Listen, they're all running around down there, shouting	something or other, and running toward the other building." It had more or	less calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. I	tried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, "Listen;	let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know how	long we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything." I don't get it, all	women have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe	not everything was taken? I tell Mamma, "Mamma, what do you need any of that	for? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!" She	says, "No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend the	night at someone else's." Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son	Alik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were	coming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He	shouts, "Come back, they're coming!" They didn't have enough time to get a	lot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my	knitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,	out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, his	wife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to	leave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and	just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs,	they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building,	maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over	there, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished	building, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more	or less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.	Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom	apartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,	Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at that	time she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and	her grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her	retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started	pounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there,	something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even	live there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and	mattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television.	They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, "My	God, what is going on around here? When will this end?" We turned off the	lights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones who	knew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, but	they didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that	he was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his	apartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works up	at the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.	They tell him, "Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one of	us." He went upstairs, and they say, "Aren't you taking anything from this	apartment?" He says, "I don't need anything." And the women who were standing	in the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were	standing in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the	first floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time	to into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty	pillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really	mad, and he says, "Where's the rug? I just put it right here!" They tell him,	"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school." He ran off in that	direction.	Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms,	there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They	just didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man,	she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told	me, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them,	the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, "Where's the girl who was here?"	And he became furious. The woman tells him, "She came to . . . " She didn't	know what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would	comb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, "She	came to and went to the basement." Now, our basement is full of water. So the	whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took	flashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been	standing there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there	to get me. Then one of them said, "There's so much water down there, she	probably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in	the basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!" I didn't know that, and	when I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn't	just want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .	After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really	didn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and	started to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all.	Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people	who sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I think	that they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, but	they could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole	brutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been	enough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?" That's	all! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not	one person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were	standing on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what are	you doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women	that if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a	bomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for	one of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway,	an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom:	if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed	to stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they	stomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, "If	you want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment." So she left.	That trick didn't work on them.	Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget	that it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that it	had happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them,	then I would forget everything, too.

I'm sorry, but the above sentence does not make sense.

It is very encouraging that a number of people took so interest in my posting.I recieved a couple of letters too,some has debated the statement that events in Bosnia are unprecedented in the history of the modern world.Those who contest this statement present the figures of the World War II.However we must keep in mind that it was a World War and no country had the POWER to stop it,today is the matter not of the POWER but of the WILL.It	seems to be that what we lack is the will.	Second point of difference (which makes it different from the holocast(sp?) ) is that at that time international community	didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event,	today inspite of all the might,the international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which	is to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bully.Hence indirecltly and possibly	unintentionally, mankind has sided with the killers.And this,I think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world.

Israeli morality pales in the face of charming events	like the string of PLO-run skyjackings in the mid 80's (remember those	TWA jokes?), and not to forget the Achille Lauro and however many airline	bombings they have committed, not to mention bombings on the streets of	Israel (It's gotten to a point where children are told not to go near any	bags or containers whose origins they don't know, because they could be	bombs), or last weeks Katyusha rocket attack on Northern Israel by Fatah,	those wonderful "mainstream moderates" with whom Israel is attempting	to negotiate.	Let's not forget the fact that more Palestinians are killed by Palestinians	than by Israelis.  Ahh yes, those charming humanitarian death squads.	I've actually seen a videotape of an interrogation (DSee the documentary	_Deadly Currents_--very neutral and balanced--seriously)--It was rather	inquisition-esque. essentially, to prove his loyalty to "the cause" of	whichever group it was that was interogating him, he had to turn in someone	else, or else face death in one of the many fun-filled ways that the death-	squads love so much--beatings, dismemberment, acid, pouring melted plastic	on the face of the 'guilty party,' and of course beheading, always my	favorite.  Did you catch the photos in the Washington Post a while back	the execution of a "collaborator?"  3 photos:	1) one Palestinian leading another at gunpoint.	2) The "collaborator" on his knees, the gun pointed at his temple.	3) The executioner standing on the corpse of the "collaborator	shouting about how this is what happens to collaborators.	Wonderful justice system, and lots of regard for Human rights.	Remember Black September?	Ok, so they just tried to take over Jordan, big deal.	I'm rambling now, but are you getting what I'm saying?

The	distinction is not trivial. Murder happens to innocent people, not people	whose line of work is to kill or be killed. It just so happened that these	soldiers, in the line of duty, were killed by the opposition. And	resistance is different from terrorism. Certainly the athletes in Munich	were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters).	Their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by	resistance fighters. Don't forget that it was the French Resistance to the	Nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the	hostile occupiers in WWII. Diplomacy has not worked with Israel and the	Lebanese people are tired of being occupied! They are now turning to the	only option they see as viable. (Don't forget that it worked in driving	out the US)	-marc	--	______________________________________________________________________________	Some people are so narrow minded they can see through a crack in a door with	both eyes.

DEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1]	Born 1972	Attended 9th Grade	Middle School No. 17	Resident at Building 4/2, Apartment 25	Microdistrict No. 3	Sumgait [Azerbaijan]	Really, people in town didn't know what was happening on February 27. I came	home from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last period	in order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life was	the same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer and	other things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my first	cousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, and	on the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuring	that I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.	When we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stopped	by a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus.	The driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the bus	begins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up to	the doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checking	passports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are not	taken for Armenians.	We set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an old	building where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road was	packed with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8th	Microdistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checking	passports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well.	Then we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burning	cars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. "Death to	the Armenians" was written on the cars.	When we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was still	quiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to call	Baku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come.	Then there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us to	come down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led us	to the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which you	enter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman was	beaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right,	that's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, people	were being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay very	long in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could,	looking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and said	things now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably a	car on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that	they be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said that	there weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing of	the building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I later	found out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. Yuri	Avakian was killed, too.	When the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could go	home. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. We	started to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. We	tried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. We	decided she had already left.	We sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with my	father. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father's	work brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in our	town. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us get	out of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address,	but my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after the	call a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they broke	down the door and came into the apartment . . .	They came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenians	were. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing we	could do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. He	read the surname "Danielian," turned the page, read "Armenian," and that alone	was enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into the	courtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him,	pushed some of the keys on the piano and said "your death has tolled." They	had knives and steel truncheons.	I had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that if	I didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parents	and said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commanded	that we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were taken	outdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started to	push her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behind	her. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they began	beating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.	We are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on their	balconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first they	strike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . I	lose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was the	first one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they are	lying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching from	their balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm is	broken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call an	ambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.	We were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 and	try to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door,	they push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, our	neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; she	sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out the	window to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as a	result of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been taken	away. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken	away, and everything will be OK.	But they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, the	ambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they received	attention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12	o'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with	some "assistants." They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives,	and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the wounds	on my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who are	in the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.	In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of them	Armenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The only	Azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,	before the 27th.	Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I was	released, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At first	they told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found out	that they were dead. My father's older brother told me.	My father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. My	mother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, the	leader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.	They were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that their	heads were smashed open and bled profusely.	At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned out	later, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had called	specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address	and dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address.	Before the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on the	phone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. He	denies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my father	answered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that he	called from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds of	automobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but had	never served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20	years old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that he	was the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.	My parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and was	two years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were to	go to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. He	went off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agricultural	projects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, and	later moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was from	the village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first in	a bookstore, and later, on a construction site.	My sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. I	always loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because it	was their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade and	wanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the Military	School. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-	sider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then join	the Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole life	long--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted it	more than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,	and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.	Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the home	of my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.	While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who had	suffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [at	their residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a long	time, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. I	also learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped	. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,	about a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding with	his parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, and	his parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We even	came to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. But	in the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates of	others, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .	Today Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,	was shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed to	recognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.	I was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decision	of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part of	Armenia.	After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to give	Karabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to live	peacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before they	can do that.	I arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.	After a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. I	think that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.	You can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of Nagorno	Karabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We had	even decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would move	here for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, and	that what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--was	wrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correct	a mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh lies	in the hands of our government.

Any person who supports the policies of the Turkish goverment directly or	indirecly is a "bad" person.	It is not your nationality that makes you bad, it is your support of the	actions of your goverment that make you "bad".	People do not hate you because of who you are but because of what you	are.

You do not need brainwashing to turn people against the Turks. Just talk to	Greeks, Arabs, Slavs, Kurds and all other people who had the luck to be under	Turkish occupation.	They will talk to you about murders,rapes,distruction.	You do not learn about Turks from history books, you learn about them from	people who experienced first hand Turkish friendliness.	Napoleon

Israelis top leaders in the past and present, always come across	as arrogant with their tough talks trying to intimidate the Arabs.	The way I see it, Israelis and Arabs have not been able to achieve peace	after almost 50 years of fighting because of the following two major reasons:	1) Arab governments are not really representative of their people, currently	most of their leaders are stupid, and/or not independent, and/or	dictators.	2) Israeli government is arrogant and none comprising.

Now, try dealing with the rest of what I wrote.	What is more, the activities of the Armenian Government seem to have been	efforts aimed at eradicating a race (the Turks) or aimed at carrying out a	one-sided feud, instead of being a struggle for liberation. From the outset,	the efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders took	the form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder, cruelty	and genocide, so that no other interpretation of them is possible. Armenian	activities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts of	terror, and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks. The element	of brute force in these activities increased steadily, culminating in mass	rebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War. Furthermore,	when the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the 1915 Sarikamis	defeat, Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area.	Although the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy, nevertheless they	were constrained by the rules of war. However, when they returned to their	country in 1917 after the Revolution, Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked	in this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum	in 1918. During this period, Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on	the local people which is recorded in historical documents.[1]	For example, let us look at a report dated 21 March 1918 which the Commander	of the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan:	"They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down	by Armenians, even the trees were cut down, and they are like a	building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word."	As for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan:	"Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning	with the excuse of forced labor in road construction, they were taken	in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army	withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian	massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked	in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places	selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs	were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after	being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part	of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the	cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering	from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived	in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.	Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not	exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in	Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything	that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them	in a destitute situation. At the present time, the people are subsisting	on some food they obtained, impelled by starvation, from Russian storages	left behind after their occupation of this area."[2]	Foreign observers who witnessed the events, including Russian Officers	who did not desert their lines, submitted detailed reports proving the	genocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war.	What is most important is that they stated in their reports 'the	massacres did not happen by chance but were planned.'[3]	At the end of the war, the German author Dr. Weiss, his Austrian colleague	Dr. Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr. Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon, Kars,	Erzurum and Batum between April 17th and May 20th 1918 to record the	cruelties. Their writings not only show the scope of Armenian activities,	but also reveal their goal and true nature.[4]	[1] (The Ottoman State, the Ministry of War), "Islam Ahalinin Ducar Olduklari	Mezalim Hakkinda Vesaike Mustenid Malumat," (Istanbul, 1918).

From Israeline 4/14	Today's MA'ARIV reports that yesterday, following Egyptian	President Hosni Mubarak's meeting with PLO Chief Yasser Arafat and	prominent Palestinian Faisal al-Husseini, the latter said that in	principle, the Palestinians have decided to participate in the	peace talks. Nonetheless, he noted that everything will be decided	upon at the meeting of the Arab foreign ministers in Damascus. The	newspaper also reports that threatening phone calls were recently	made to houses of several of the senior members of the Palestinian	delegation to the peace talks. The threats, in Arabic, demanded	that the delegates not go to Washington to, "sell out the	Palestinian people." One caller threatened, "Should you go, you	will not find your family alive upon your return." The newspaper	states that such phone calls were received, as far as is known, at	the houses of Faisal al-Husseini, Hanan Ashrawi and others.	----	Naftaly Stramer 			 | Intergraph Electronics	Internet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com      | 6101 Lookout Road, Suite A	Voice: (303)581-2370  FAX: (303)581-9972 | Boulder, CO 80301	"Quality is everybody's job, and it's everybody's job to watch all that they can."

The Orders for the Turkish Extermination of the Armenians #17	To the children of genocide: "Send them away into the Desert"	This is part of a continuing series of articles containing official Turkish	wartime (WW1) governmental telegrams, in translation, entailing the orders	for the extermination of the Armenian people in Turkey. Generally, these	telegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha,	for example, we have the following set regarding children:	"To the Government of Aleppo.	November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging to	the Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum	[hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslem	families and received as servants when they are left alone through	the death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collect	all such children in your province and send them to the places of	deportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this to	the people.	Minister of the Interior,	Talaat" [1]	"To the Government of Aleppo.	September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not the	time to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging their	lives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.	Minister of the Interior,	Talaat" [2]	"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.	November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in the	orphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to their	places of exile.	Abdullahad Nuri. [3]	"To the Government of Aleppo.	January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have been	opened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this is	done through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contempt	of it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children or	any attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to it	purpose, since it considers the survival of these children as	detrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be received	into the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establish	special orphanages for them.	Minister of the Interior,	Talaat." [4]	"To the Government of Aleppo.	Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the tortures	to which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away with	the caravans.	Minister of the Interior,	Talaat" [5]	"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.	At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widows	of Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it is	not expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left by	Armenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving trouble	in the future. It is necessary that these children should be turned	out of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place of	deportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sent	away, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.	Minister of the Interior,	Talaat" [6]	In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirs	about a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and "rationalizing" this	ultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:	"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for	its own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinks	it moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know I	shall die for it." [7]	These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial of	Talaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government never	questioned these "death march orders" until 1986, during a time when the world	was again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.	For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, the	Turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were	ever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a	study by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.	If one were to examine the sample "authentic text" provided in the Turkish	Historical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, it	too would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by the	Turkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish or	Persian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language is	a forgery.	Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul,	Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocide	architect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in a	heightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as a	focal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.	This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathological	denial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose only	crime was to be born Armenian.	- - - references - - -	[1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60	[2] ibid, page 60	[3] ibid, page 60	[4] ibid, page 61	[5] ibid, page 61	[6] ibid, page 62	[7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (and	London), 1926, page 387	--	David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | "How do we explain Turkish troops on	S.D.P.A.

Now tell me, did you also condone Saddam's scuds on israeli 'soldiers' in, let's	say, Tel Aviv ? From what I understand, a lot of palestineans cheered. What does	it show?

Virtually everyone not in the Khmer Rouge suffered the "killing fields".

Then you must be living in an alternate universe. Where were they?	An Appeal to Mankind	During the last three years Azerbaijan and its multinational	population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of	the Soviet Union. All humanitarian, constitutional human rights	guaranteed by the UN Charter, Universal Declaration of Human	Rights, Helsinki Agreements, Human Problems International Forums,	documents signed by the Soviet Union - all of them are violated.	The USSR's President, government bodies do not defend Azerbaijan	though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to	guarantee life and peace.	The 140,000 strong army of Armenian terrorists with Moscow's	tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against	Azerbaijan. As a result, a part of Azerbaijan has been occupied	and annexed, hundreds of people killed, thousands wounded.	Some 200,000 Azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly	deported from the Armenian SSR, their historical homeland.	Together with them 64,000 Russians and 22,000 Kurds have also	been driven out, a part of them now settled in Azerbaijan.	Some 40,000 Turkish-Meskhetians, Lezghins and representatives	of other Caucasian nationalities who escaped from the Central	Asia where the President and government bodies did not guarantee	them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.	One of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against	Azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the	Armenian extremists' destruction of the Karabakh scientific	experimental base of The Institute of Genetics and Selection	of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR.	We beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance,	for the honour and dignity of 7 million Azerbaijanis are	violated, its territory, culture  and history are trampled,	its people are shot. There is persistent negative image of	Azerbaijanians abroad, and this defamation is spread over	the whole world by Soviet mass media, Armenian lobby in the	USSR and the United States.	One of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and	generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance	while the truth is that all these shootings and recent	events stem from the territorial claims of Armenia on	Azerbaijan.	It is a well documented fact that before the conflict there	were no frictions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis on the	issue of Karabakh. Hundreds and thousands Armenians placidly	and calmly lived and worked in Azerbaijan land, had their	representatives in all government bodies of the Azerbaijan	SSR.	We are for a united, indivisible, sovereign Azerbaijan, we	are for a common Caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one	of the founding fathers of the Azerbaijan Democratic	Republic - Muhammed Emin Rasulzade.	But all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the	Soviet leadership in favour of the Armenian expansionists	encouraged by Moscow and intended to create a new '1,000	Year Reich' - the 'Great Armenia' - by annexing the	neighboring lands.	The world public opinion shed tears to save the whales,	suffers for penguins dying out in the Antarctic Continent.	But what about the lives of seven million human beings?	If these people are Muslims, does it mean that they are	less valuable? Can people be discriminated by their	colour of skin or religion, by their residence or other	attributes?	All people are brothers, and we appeal to our brothers	for help and understanding. This is not the first appeal	of Azerbaijan to the world public opinion. Our previous	appeals were unheard. However, we still carry the hope	that the truth beyond the Russian and Armenian propaganda	will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and	stimulate at least as much help and compassion for	Azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

When did the press report	>   it to the world?	But perhaps Turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the Caucasus	in the name of peace and democracy. The Armenians are Christians, the	Azerbaijanis are Moslems, and Islam is a religion especially unloved	by the democrat-westernizers. Besides, at the root of this conflict	lie the territorial claims on Azerbaijan, a consequence of which	were the blood and suffering of innocent Azeri people, hundreds of	thousands of refugees, and gross violations of human rights.	Recently Armenians attacked the Azeri town of Khojaly and massacred	thousands of Azeris. The Paris-based 'Association for Democracy and	Human Rights in Azerbaijan' puts the number of Khojali victims	at 3,145. Some of the dead were scalped and mutilated. This whole	thing has now gone entirely too far.	>   Want to know what will bring the story in Armenia to the front	>   page?

They already did. The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians	78 years ago in the Ottoman Empire is being reenacted again - this	time in Azerbaijan. There are remarkable similarities between the	plots, the perpetrators, and the underdogs.	Report taken from The New York Times, Tuesday, March 3, 1992	MASSACRE BY ARMENIANS BEING REPORTED	Agdam,Azerbaijan,March 2 (Reuters) - Fresh evidence emerged today	of a massacre of civilians by Armenian militants in Nagorno-Karabakh,	a predominantly Armenian enclave of Azerbaijan.	The republic of Armenia reiterated denials that its militants had killed	1,000 people in the Azerbaijani populated town of Khojaly last week and	massacred men, women and children fleeing the carnage across snow-covered	mountain passes.	But dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to Azerbaijani	reports of a massacre.	Scalping Reported	Azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region	by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their	heads blown off. They said shooting by Armenians has prevented them	from retrieving more bodies.	"Women and children have been scalped," said Assad Faradshev, an aide	to Nagorno-Karabakh's Azerbaijani Governor. "When we began to pick up bodies,	they began firing at us."	The Azerbaijani militia chief in Agdam, Rashid Mamedov, said: "The bodies	are lying there like flocks of sheep. Even the fascists did nothing like this."	Truckloads of Bodies	Near Agdam on the outskirts of Nagorno-Karabakh, a Reuters photographer,	Frederique Lengaigne, said she had seen two trucks filled with Azerbaijani	bodies.	"In the first one I counted 35, and it looked as though there were as	many in the second," she said. "Some had their head cut off, and many had	been burned. They were all men, and a few had been wearing khaki uniforms.	Serdar Argic	'We closed the roads and mountain passes that	might serve as ways of escape for the Turks	and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'

Who are them?  If by them you mean the non-religious Jews, I think	you should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and their	supporters are religious.  The other part of the problem is, to my	knowledge, not that the palestinians don't want to be a part of Israel,	as much as they would accept (for the most part) being full citizens	of Israel, with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded Israeli	citizens.  What they object to is the current limbo in which they find	themselves.	--	Shai Guday              | Stealth bombers,	OS Software Engineer    |	Thinking Machines Corp. |	the winged ninjas of the skies.

I have the right to live there UNDER the established	government, right?  Exactly.  Thus, the Palestinian Arabs	should be content to live under Israeli rule, but should cease	clamoring for an independent state.  OR, they should get one in	Gaza and, if it can be worked out, part of the West Bank.  This	is what I have proposed all along, Nabil.	Jon, jac2y@virginia.edu

Well, I'm not an Arab, but I think you	are brain is full of shit if you really believe what you said.  The	bombardment of civilian and none civilian areas in Lebanon by Israel is	very consistent with its policy of intimidation.  That is the only	policy that has been practiced by the so called only democracy in	the middle east!	I was merley pointing out that the other side is also suffering.	Like I said, I'm not an Arab but if I was, say a Lebanese, you bet	I would defende my homeland against any invader by any means.

Do seiges and constant attacks on villiages	count as acts of war, or is that only when the Jews do them?	January, 1948: Arab Liberation Army attacks Kfar Szold	1000 men attack Kfar Etzion, 14 miles south of Jerusalem,	after cutting off the supply lines to it.	Attacks on Yehiam (Western Galilee) and kibbutz Tirat Tzvi.	By Mid-March, The Jewish settlements in the Negev had been cut off from	land links with the rest of the Jewish population.	The Etzion group of villiages, near Hebron, had been cut off,	while 42 members of a convoy trying to supply Yehiam were	slaughtered, cutting off the villiage.	Jerusalem was under seige, being cut off from its supply route from	Tel Aviv (the bombed out supply trucks have been left on the side	of that road to this day in memoriam).  By this time, 1200 Jews	had been killed.	Of course, this isn't war, since it's only the Arabs attacking.	Just like last week when the Fatah launched Katyusha rockets	against Northern israel.  Where does uprising end and war begin?	Will it still be 'Intifadah' when the PLO brings in tanks?	>--	>Joseph Askew, Gauche and Proud  In the autumn stillness, see the Pleiades,	>jaskew@spam.maths.adelaide.edu  Remote in thorny deserts, fell the grief.	>Disclaimer?
